  # Include the tasks for nodes which can not talk to other nodes due to
  # missing pcs auth tokens. The pcs-auth-*.yml contains "run_once: yes" as
  # running the auth on one node is sufficient (auth tokens are distributed by
  # pcs automatically). By appling "when" here and "run_once" in the included
  # task, it is achieved that the pcs auth command is run once on one of the
  # nodes which lack pcs auth tokens.
