# ha_cluster
![CI Testing](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/ha_cluster/workflows/tox/badge.svg)

An Ansible role for managing High Availability Clustering.

## Limitations

* Supported OS: RHEL 8.3+, Fedora 31+
* Systems running RHEL are expected to be registered and have High-Availability
  repositories accessible.
* The role replaces the configuration of HA Cluster on specified nodes. Any
  settings not specified in the role variables will be lost.
* The role is capable of configuring:
  * single-link or multi-link cluster
  * Corosync transport options including compression and encryption
  * Corosync totem options
  * Corosync quorum options
  * SBD
  * Pacemaker cluster properties
  * stonith and resources
  * resource constraints

## Role Variables

### Defined in `defaults/main.yml`

#### `ha_cluster_enable_repos`

boolean, default: `true`

RHEL and CentOS only, enable repositories contaning needed packages

#### `ha_cluster_cluster_present`

boolean, default: `true`

If set to `true`, HA cluster will be configured on the hosts according to other
variables. If set to `false`, all HA Cluster configuration will be purged from
target hosts.

#### `ha_cluster_start_on_boot`

boolean, default: `true`

If set to `true`, cluster services will be configured to start on boot. If set
to `false`, cluster services will be configured not to start on boot.

#### `ha_cluster_fence_agent_packages`

list of fence agent packages to install, default: fence-agents-all, fence-virt

#### `ha_cluster_extra_packages`

list of additional packages to be installed, default: no packages

This variable can be used to install additional packages not installed
automatically by the role, for example custom resource agents.

It is possible to specify fence agents here as well. However,
`ha_cluster_fence_agent_packages` is preferred for that, so that its default
value is overriden.

#### `ha_cluster_hacluster_password`

string, no default - must be specified

Password of the `hacluster` user. This user has full access to a cluster. It is
recommended to vault encrypt the value, see
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html for details.

#### `ha_cluster_corosync_key_src`

path to Corosync authkey file, default: `null`

Authentication and encryption key for Corosync communication. It is highly
recommended to have a unique value for each cluster. The key should be 256
bytes of random data.

If value is provided, it is recommended to vault encrypt it. See
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html for details.

If no key is specified, a key already present on the nodes will be used. If
nodes don't have the same key, a key from one node will be distributed to other
nodes so that all nodes have the same key. If no node has a key, a new key will
be generated and distributed to the nodes.

If this variable is set, `ha_cluster_regenerate_keys` is ignored for this key.

#### `ha_cluster_pacemaker_key_src`

path to Pacemaker authkey file, default: `null`

Authentication and encryption key for Pacemaker communication. It is highly
recommended to have a unique value for each cluster. The key should be 256
bytes of random data.

If value is provided, it is recommended to vault encrypt it. See
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html for details.

If no key is specified, a key already present on the nodes will be used. If
nodes don't have the same key, a key from one node will be distributed to other
nodes so that all nodes have the same key. If no node has a key, a new key will
be generated and distributed to the nodes.

If this variable is set, `ha_cluster_regenerate_keys` is ignored for this key.

#### `ha_cluster_fence_virt_key_src`

path to fence-virt or fence-xvm pre-shared key file, default: `null`

Authentication key for fence-virt or fence-xvm fence agent.

If value is provided, it is recommended to vault encrypt it. See
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html for details.

If no key is specified, a key already present on the nodes will be used. If
nodes don't have the same key, a key from one node will be distributed to other
nodes so that all nodes have the same key. If no node has a key, a new key will
be generated and distributed to the nodes.

If this variable is set, `ha_cluster_regenerate_keys` is ignored for this key.

If you let the role to generate new key, you are supposed to copy the key to
your nodes' hypervisor to ensure that fencing works.

#### `ha_cluster_pcsd_public_key_src`, `ha_cluster_pcsd_private_key_src`

path to pcsd TLS certificate and key, default: `null`

TLS certificate and private key for pcsd. If this is not specified, a
certificate - key pair already present on the nodes will be used. If
certificate - key pair is not present, a random new one will be generated.

If private key value is provided, it is recommended to vault encrypt it. See
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html for details.

If these variables are set, `ha_cluster_regenerate_keys` is ignored for this
certificate - key pair.

#### `ha_cluster_regenerate_keys`

boolean, default: `false`

If this is set to `true`, pre-shared keys and TLS certificates will be
regenerated.

This variable defines Pacemaker resources (including stonith) configured by the
role. The items are as follows:

* `id` (mandatory) - ID of a resource.
* `agent` (mandatory) - Name of a resource or stonith agent, for example
  `ocf:pacemaker:Dummy` or `stonith:fence_xvm`. It is mandatory to use
  `stonith:` for stonith agents. For resource agents, it is possible to use a
  short name, such as `Dummy` instead of `ocf:pacemaker:Dummy`. However, if
  several agents with the same short name are installed, the role will fail as
  it will be unable to decide which agent should be used. Therefore, it is
  recommended to use full names.
* `instance_attrs` (optional) - List of sets of the resource's instance
  attributes. Currently, only one set is supported. The exact names and values
  of attributes, as well as whether they are mandatory or not, depends on the
  resource or stonith agent.

  Currently, only one set is supported.
* `operations` (optional) - List of the resource's operations.
  * `action` (mandatory) - Operation action as defined by Pacemaker and the
    resource or stonith agent.
  * `attrs` (mandatory) - Operation options, at least one option must be
    specified.

This variable defines resource order constraints. They tell the cluster the
order in which certain resource actions should occur. There are two types of
order constraints: a simple one for two resources, and a set constraint for
multiple resources.

#### `ha_cluster_constraints_ticket`

structure, default: no constraints

This variable defines resource ticket constraints. They let you specify the
resources depending on a certain ticket. There are two types of ticket
constraints: a simple one for two resources, and a set constraint for multiple
resources.

Structure for simple constraints:
```yaml
ha_cluster_constraints_ticket:
  - resource:
      id: resource-id
      role: resource-role
    ticket: ticket-name
    id: constraint-id
    options:
      - name: loss-policy
        value: loss-policy-value
      - name: option-name
        value: option-value
```
* `resource` (mandatory) - Specification of a resource the constraint applies
  to.
  * `id` (mandatory) - Resource ID.
  * `role` (optional) - You may limit the constraint to the specified resource
    role: `Started`, `Unpromoted`, `Promoted`.
* `ticket` (mandatory) - Name of a ticket the resource depends on.
* `id` (optional) - ID of the constraint. If not specified, it will be
  autogenerated.
* `options` (optional) - List of name-value dictionaries.
  * `loss-policy` (optional) - Action that should happen to the resource if the
    ticket is revoked.

You may take a look at
[an example](#creating-a-cluster-with-resource-constraints).

Structure for set constraints:
```yaml
ha_cluster_constraints_ticket:
  - resource_sets:
      - resource_ids:
          - resource-id1
          - resource-id2
        options:
          - name: option-name
            value: option-value
    ticket: ticket-name
    id: constraint-id
    options:
      - name: option-name
        value: option-value
```
* `resource_sets` (mandatory) - List of resource sets.
  * `resource_ids` (mandatory) - List of resources in a set.
  * `options` (optional) - List of name-value dictionaries fine-tuning how
    resources in the sets are treated by the constraint.
* `ticket` (mandatory) - Same as above.
* `id` (optional) - Same as above.
* `options` (optional) - Same as above.

### Inventory

#### Nodes' names and addresses
Nodes' names and addresses can be configured in inventory. This is optional. If
no names or addresses are configured, play's targets will be used.

Example inventory with targets `node1` and `node2`:
```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    node1:
      ha_cluster:
        node_name: node-A
        pcs_address: node1-address
        corosync_addresses:
          - 192.168.1.11
          - 192.168.2.11
    node2:
      ha_cluster:
        node_name: node-B
        pcs_address: node2-address:2224
        corosync_addresses:
          - 192.168.1.12
          - 192.168.2.12
```

* `node_name` - the name of a node in a cluster
* `pcs_address` - an address used by pcs to communicate with the node, it can
  be a name, FQDN or an IP address and it can contain port
* `corosync_addresses` - list of addresses used by Corosync, all nodes must
  have the same number of addresses and the order of the addresses matters

#### SBD watchdog and devices
When using SBD, you may optionally configure watchdog and SBD devices for each
node in inventory. Even though all SBD devices must be shared to and accesible
from all nodes, each node may use different names for the devices. Watchdog may
be different for each node as well. See also [SBD
variables](#ha_cluster_sbd_enabled).

Example inventory with targets `node1` and `node2`:
```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    node1:
      ha_cluster:
        sbd_watchdog: /dev/watchdog2
        sbd_devices:
          - /dev/vdx
          - /dev/vdy
    node2:
      ha_cluster:
        sbd_watchdog: /dev/watchdog1
        sbd_devices:
          - /dev/vdw
          - /dev/vdz
```

* `sbd_watchdog` (optional) - Watchdog device to be used by SBD. Defaults to
  `/dev/watchdog` if not set.
* `sbd_devices` (optional) - Devices to use for exchanging SBD messages and for
  monitoring. Defaults to empty list if not set.
